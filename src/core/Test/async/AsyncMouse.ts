/**
 * Asynchronous mouse position, in screen (frame) coordinates: the center of the screen is
 * (0.4, 0.3). Ported from "Perfect Async Mouse Screen XY" by ModdieMads
 * (scripts/perfectMouseAsync.lua), with two changes:
 *  - the tiles are normal by-type frames rather than the simple frames of an imported .toc/.fdf
 *    template, as MEC is injected into maps it cannot add files to. Simple frames turned out to
 *    be unusable here anyway: a by-type SIMPLEBUTTON keeps the hit area of its parent, so the
 *    first tile created covers the whole screen and shadows every other one,
 *  - the demo graphics and the stabilized (buffered) getters are left out.
 *
 * How it works: a tooltip attached to a simple button is marked visible by the game, locally,
 * while the cursor hovers that button. BlzFrameIsVisible on it is therefore a local mouse
 * sensor, needing no event, hence no latency. A lattice of such tiles is laid out around the
 * last known position, fine in the middle and coarse further away, and re-centers itself on
 * every hit, so it converges on the cursor.
 *
 * Visible frames swallow the mouse, so the lattice is only shown one tick out of FLICKER_TICKS:
 * the hover state of a tile keeps updating while it is invisible, which is the trick that makes
 * the whole thing possible. A click landing exactly on a flicker tick is still lost.
 *
 * Asynchronous: the position differs from one machine to another and may never feed synced logic.
