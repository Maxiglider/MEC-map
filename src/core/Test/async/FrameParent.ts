/**
 * Which parent the lattice and the catchers hang from. It decides two things at once:
 *
 *  - 'gameUi': the safe one, but its children cannot leave the 4:3 center of the screen, so the
 *    side bands of a wide screen are out of reach ("The Big UI-Frame Tutorial" by Tasyen,
 *    section "4:3 Limitation"),
 *  - 'consoleUiBackdrop': no 4:3 limit, but the "-ui" command hides that frame
 *    (EnableDisableInterface.ts), and a hidden parent hides its children: the tracker goes blind,
 *  - 'worldFrame': the 3D view, which "-ui" leaves alone, but its children are bounded to the
 *    4:3 center just the same,
 *  - 'leaderboard': the parent MEC already builds for that very purpose in
 *    DisablingInterface/EnableDisableInterface.ts ("Frame parent to allow above 4:3"): a
 *    Leaderboard, sized to nothing, with its backdrop and title hidden. It escapes the 4:3 limit
 *    and "-ui" does not touch it. It only exists two seconds into the game, which is before
 *    anything here is created.
 *
 * A frame cannot be re-parented once created, hence a constant rather than a runtime switch.
