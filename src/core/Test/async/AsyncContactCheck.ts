 * hero looks, since it is the only one knowing where it really is, and it only looks: what follows
 * a contact belongs to the game, from a score to a revived ally, so it is announced and every
 * machine runs the very same handler the immolation used to call, on the same turn.
 *
 * Any other hero stands on every machine at once, so every machine looks for its contacts itself
 * and handles them on the spot, telling nothing: everything read is synced state, so the same
 * contacts are found everywhere on the same turn, and a packet per machine per contact would
 * multiply what one machine alone has to say.
 *
 * The reach is the collision size of the hero, which the invisible unit was built from.
 *
 * Monsters carry the ability Locust to be unclickable, and the enumeration natives ignore those,
 * so the engine cannot be asked what stands nearby: the candidates come from MEC's own index, the
 * contact chunks, which answer with the monsters of the one chunk the hero stands in per tier.
