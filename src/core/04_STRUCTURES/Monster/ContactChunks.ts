/**
 * Where every monster can be found, without looking at all of them.
 *
 * MEC's own contact check asks, fifty times a second and for every hero, what that hero touches.
 * Walking the 1518 monsters of a map for each of the 24 heroes is 1.8M tests a second, which no
 * Warcraft III machine survives - so each monster is registered once in the chunks of a grid it
 * can be found in, and a hero only ever looks at the chunk it stands in.
 *
 * The invariant that makes so few lookups enough: a monster is registered in EVERY chunk its own
 * reach overlaps around everywhere it can stand, and a hero asks for the chunks its step went
 * through, widened by its own collision size. Whatever the two sizes are, the point lying at the
 * monster's reach from it, towards the hero, belongs to both - so one chunk holds the monster and
 * is asked for, and no contact can be missed.
 *
 * Each side is therefore paid for by the one it belongs to: the monster pads with its reach, the
 * hero widens its own query with its own size, and the step it took is asked for rather than padded
 * in. Padding is read at every tick of every hero, while a query is only ever the business of the
 * one hero making it - which also means a hero growing during the game costs the index nothing.
 *
 * The index is only an accelerator over synced state: as long as it stays exact, the contacts
 * found do not depend on the tier sizes, which makes them a pure performance knob (see
 * docs/MEC_CONTACT_CHECK_TO_REPLACE_IMMOLATION.md).
 */

 * The longest step a hero can take between two contact checks. A step longer than this is not a
 * step at all - a revive, a teleport, a level change - and the check treats it as a landing, so
