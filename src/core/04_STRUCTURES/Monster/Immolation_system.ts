/**
 * The immolation is how the engine used to notice that a hero touched a monster: every monster unit
 * carried an immolation ability whose radius is the collision radius of its monster type, and the
 * invisible unit following the hero took the damage (see InvisUnit_is_getting_damage).
 *
 * MEC finds its contacts itself now (ContactCheck), so no monster is given that ability any
 * more: an immolation radius is a number MEC reads to know how big a monster is, not something the
 * engine applies. The e2e tests "immolationOn" / "immolationOff" hand it out again at runtime, to
 * compare the two - they are what the measurements of
 * docs/MEC_CONTACT_CHECK_TO_REPLACE_IMMOLATION.md were taken with.
