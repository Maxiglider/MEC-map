/**
 * What the machine of an async player tells the others about its hero.
 *
 * While the hero is an effect, only that machine knows where it really is, and it moves it alone:
 * the slide never waits for the network. The others replay. BlzSendSyncData carries what they need,
 * and the event it raises fires on every machine in the same game turn, which is what turns a local
 * truth into synchronized state.
 *
 * The kinds of packets:
 *  - POSITION, ten times a second: everything the others need to carry the movement on by
 *    themselves, slide speed and rotation speed included. A slide terrain or a static slide
 *    changes nothing else, so they travel no other way,
 *  - TERRAIN, the one moment the slide waits: where it ends on walkable ground or on a death
 *    terrain that does not forgive. It carries no conclusion: every machine, the sender included,
 *    runs the very same check at the position and with the state it carries, and the map being
 *    the same for everybody, they reach the same conclusion,
 *  - DEATH, the moment this machine sees the hero die, so it dies at the same spot everywhere,
 *  - CONTACT, whenever the hero touches something. Its consequences change the game itself, from
 *    a score to a revived ally, so they cannot be drawn by the machine that noticed alone,
 *  - EVENT, what the others should see or hear about without it deciding anything: the hooks of a
 *    terrain change, an effect of the god mode.

 *    relative value would drift, an absolute one corrects itself at every packet,
 *  - turnPerPeriod, the current angular speed. The slide accelerates its turns, so without it a
 *    receiver would restart that acceleration from its own value and draw another curve,
 *  - the vertical state, as for a death,
 *  - slideSpeed and rotationSpeed, which the terrain and the static slides under the hero change
 *    on its own machine only,
 *  - terrainTypeId, the terrain the hero was last seen on (0 for none): its gravity and whether it
 *    lets the hero turn, and the state a replayed check starts from,
 *  - staticSlideId (-1 for none) and staticSlidePreviousSpeed, the static slide its own machine has
 *    it in and the speed that lane gives back. Only read at its death: every machine gives the body
 *    back to that lane, which carries it on.
