/**
 * How a mortar (a monster attacking the ground, see Monster.setAttackGroundPos) hurts the heroes: with the
 * damage of its attack as set in the object editor, before any armor, times the factor of the area the
 * hero stands in - full, medium or small damage, as the weapon of the mortar sets them.
 *
 * The engine knows when the shell lands and what damage it rolled, but only tells it to a unit it hurts.
 * So each mortar gets a sensor at the point it attacks: an invisible unit of the heroes of 2.1c, which
 * nothing but that splash hurts. Its damage is read before armor, then taken back, and every hero is
 * judged from where it stands. The areas are measured the way the engine measures them (measured in the
 * game with sensors of two collision sizes around an impact): from the point of impact to the edge of the
 * collision circle of the unit, so a hero gets an area when its distance to that point, minus its
 * collision size, is within the radius.
 *
 * The damage events of the sensor happen on every machine at once. A hero every machine sees is judged
 * there, by all of them. A hero sliding as an effect is only seen right by its own machine: that machine
 * judges it and tells every machine the damage (MEC_AHM), which they all apply when it arrives. A shell
 * that kills it for sure stops its effect there at once, as a killing contact does, so that it dies where
 * the shell hit it rather than a latency further.
