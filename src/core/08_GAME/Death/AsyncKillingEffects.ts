 * The killing effect of a monster, for a hero sliding async: shown at once to its own player, and
 * exploding where the hero dies for every player.
 *
 * An effect is an agent, and making or destroying an agent on one machine alone desyncs the game.
 * So every machine makes, for each such player, one effect per killing model any monster type has,
 * and keeps it under the ground at 0, 0. The machine of that player only moves the one it needs onto
 * its hero the moment it is touched, and replays it: moving an effect makes nothing, and may differ
 * from one machine to another. When the hero dies, every machine plays that model on its unit, named
 * by the death packet: see takeKillingEffectModelOfDeath.
